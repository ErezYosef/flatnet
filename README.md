# flatnet-separable
This repo contains the test code for the lensless reconstruction algorithm (Proposed-T) proposed in ICCV 2019 paper **Towards Photorealistic Reconstruction of Highly Multiplexed Lensless Images**

Use the notebook **FlatNet-separable.ipynb** to evaluate flatnet on captured measurements.
